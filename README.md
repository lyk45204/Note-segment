# Note-segment

use HMM to realize note segment. 
At first, reproduce Pyin's note segment part.
Use sonic annotator to get pitchtrack and rms(amplitude) track from monophonic vocal track

The framework contains batchreading, preprocess, note segment, evaluation, plot note segmentation result.

There are several stages. The first is to reproduce. The second is to do modification.
